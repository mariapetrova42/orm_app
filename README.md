# orm_app
This project was done as a part of the coursework for my Senior Seminar in COmputer Science at Lake Forest College: Software Development for Web Applications.
Certain files were provided by Professor Craig D. Knuckles, like init.php, class_data_operations.php, and class_pageable listing. 
The live version of the site may be found at http://csci.lakeforest.edu/~petrovam/csci488/mpapp, until the school takes it down.
The assignment description is below.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
Create a comprehensive, database driven Web Application with:
Multiple, related database tables.
Secured/verified API access (to your existing API) with access summary logs.
Logon state giving access to multiple pages with user logon history.
New shared secret API involving complex database join operation.

General Requirements
You must use the ORM/AR framework.
Single record SQL transactions must be done using AR objects.
Any custom SQL statements you create should be in methods in table-specific ORM classes (see my examples). There should be no SQL in the PHP files that generate web pages or API output. The exception is the Shakespeare API, which I do NOT expect you to modify in that respect.
